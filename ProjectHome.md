Funzy is an implementation of a **Fuzzy Logic** reasoning engine in Java.

Fuzzy logic is derived from _fuzzy set theory_ dealing with _reasoning_ that is approximate rather than precisely deduced from classical _predicate logic_. It can be thought of as the application side of fuzzy set theory dealing with well thought out real world expert values for a complex problem.
Fuzzy logic allows for set membership values to range (inclusively) between 0 and 1, and in its linguistic form, imprecise concepts like "slightly", "quite" and "very". Specifically, it allows partial membership in a set. It is related to fuzzy sets and possibility theory. It was introduced in 1965 by Lotfi Zadeh at the University of California, Berkeley.

Funzy exploits the strengths of Java5 and intensively use Google libraries, such as [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice) and [Collections](http://code.google.com/p/google-collections).
